# ETL-Project
COVID-19 Data Analysis Using ETL Processes

# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 vaccination rates and case counts to understand the relationship between vaccination progress and case reduction across different countries. Utilizing Python for scripting, SQLite for data storage, and Tableau Public for visualization, this project follows a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to prepare and analyze data.
# Tools and Technologies
Python: Used for scripting and automating the ETL process.
SQLite: A lightweight, disk-based database used for storing processed data.
DB Browser for SQLite: A GUI tool to facilitate database design and query execution.
Pandas: A Python library for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
Tableau Public: Used for visualizing and sharing insights from the data.
Data Source
The data was sourced from "Our World in Data," which provides an extensive dataset on COVID-19 vaccination rates, case counts, and other relevant metrics. The dataset can be accessed here.
# Methodology
Step 1: Environment Setup
Python and SQLite were installed, and a virtual environment was set up to manage dependencies.
Necessary Python packages such as Pandas and SQLAlchemy were installed.
Step 2: Data Extraction
A Python script was used to download the dataset from the provided URL.
The data was successfully downloaded and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Step 3: Data Transformation
The data was filtered to include relevant columns such as date, location, total cases, new cases, total vaccinations, and people vaccinated.
Date columns were converted to datetime format, and missing values were forward-filled to maintain continuity in time series data.
Step 4: Data Loading
The transformed data was loaded into an SQLite database using SQLAlchemy, facilitating structured storage and efficient querying.
Step 5: Data Querying and Analysis
SQL queries were executed to analyze the data:
A query to find the location with the maximum vaccinations.
Yearly aggregation queries to identify years with maximum and minimum total cases.
Insights were visualized in Tableau Public, providing interactive and engaging visual representations of the data trends.
# Results
Analysis of COVID-19 Data: Vaccinations and Case Trends
The provided SQL query results offer significant insights into the COVID-19 pandemic's dynamics, particularly focusing on vaccination efforts and the annual trends in case counts. Below is a detailed analysis based on the outputs from the executed SQL queries.
# Maximum Vaccinations by Location
The query results for the maximum vaccinations administered by location reveal some intriguing data points:
Yemen and World: Both Yemen and the global aggregate (World) have the highest recorded total vaccinations, each with a total of approximately 13.57 billion vaccinations. This exceptionally high number for Yemen might suggest a data anomaly or reporting error, as it is unusually high for the country's population and known vaccine supply issues.
Australia and Asia: Both regions show substantial vaccination numbers, each with over 9.1 billion vaccinations administered. These figures likely reflect a robust healthcare response to the pandemic, with widespread vaccination campaigns.
This data highlights the disparities in vaccination efforts globally, with some regions achieving significantly higher numbers, potentially due to better access to vaccines, more efficient healthcare infrastructure, or larger populations.
# Year with Maximum and Minimum Total Cases
The analysis of COVID-19 cases by year provides a clear picture of the pandemic's progression:
2023: This year recorded the highest number of total cases, approximately 1.24 trillion cases. This staggering number suggests a massive surge in cases, possibly due to new variants, reduced immunity, or changes in testing/reporting standards. However, such a high figure could also be indicative of cumulative reporting or data errors.
2020: The year the pandemic began shows the lowest number of cases, with about 301 billion total cases reported. As this was the onset year of the pandemic, the lower number reflects the initial spread before the virus reached global proportions.
# Conclusions and Recommendations
Data Verification: The unusually high figures for both vaccinations and total cases suggest potential data inconsistencies or errors. It is recommended to verify these figures with additional sources or review the data collection and reporting mechanisms for accuracy.
Healthcare Policy: For regions like Yemen showing anomalously high vaccination numbers, policymakers should investigate to ensure accurate data reporting and effective vaccine distribution. For countries with lower vaccination rates, efforts should be increased to secure vaccine supplies and enhance public health campaigns.
Preparedness for Future Surges: The significant increase in cases in 2023 highlights the need for continued vigilance and preparedness in the healthcare system, including maintaining sufficient medical supplies, enhancing testing facilities, and encouraging vaccination.
Public Health Strategy: Countries should continue to monitor COVID-19 trends and adapt their health strategies accordingly. This includes not only managing vaccinations and treatments but also implementing public health measures to prevent the spread during surges.
This analysis underscores the importance of robust health data systems and the need for continuous monitoring and adjustment of public health strategies in response to evolving pandemic dynamics.
